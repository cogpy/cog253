SUMMARY OF THE PATTERN LANGUAGE   
253 patterns on {{settlements}}, {{structures}} and {{creation}} 
To look for patterns dealing with particular topics, use the following topic finder: please click on the topic in the following list.... {{regions}}... {{settlements}} and country boundaries... urban {{structures}}... {{localities}}... networks... {{localities}} {{structures}}... local centers... {{structures}}... living {{spaces}}

{{settlements}}  
---  
|  The language begins with patterns that define {{settlements}} and {{localities}}. These patterns can never be designed or built in one fell swoop - but patient piecemeal growth, designed in such a way that every individual act is always helping to create or generate these larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the years, make a {{localities}} that has these global patterns in it.   
---|---  
|  First, one all important comment about the {{regions}} as a whole:   
  
---|---  
|  1\. INDEPENDENT {{regions}}  
---|---  
|  Within each {{regions}} work toward those regional policies which will protect the land and mark the limits of the {{settlements}}:   
  
---|---  
|  2\. THE DISTRIBUTION OF {{settlements}}  3\. {{settlements}} COUNTRY FINGERS  4\. AGRICULTURAL VALLEYS  5\. LACE OF COUNTRY {{pathways}}  6\. COUNTRY {{settlements}}  7\. THE COUNTRYSIDE   
---|---  
|  Through {{settlements}} policies, encourage the piecemeal formation of those major {{structures}} which define the {{settlements}}:   
  
---|---  
|  8\. MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES  9\. SCATTERED WORK  10\. MAGIC OF THE {{settlements}}  11\. LOCAL TRANSPORT {{spaces}}   
---|---  
|  Build up these larger {{settlements}} patterns from the grass roots, through action essentially controlled by two levels of self-governing {{localities}}, which exist as physically identifiable places:   
  
---|---  
|  12\. {{localities}} OF 7000  13\. SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY  14\. IDENTIFIABLE {{localities}}  15\. {{localities}} BOUNDARY   
---|---  
|  Connect {{localities}} to one another by encouraging the growth of the following networks:   
  
---|---  
|  16\. WEB OF PUBLIC {{movement}}  17\. RING {{pathways}}  18\. NETWORK OF LEARNING  19\. WEB OF SHOPPING  20\. MINI-BUSES   
---|---  
|  Establish {{localities}} and {{localities}} policy to control the character of the local environment according to the following fundamental principles:   
  
---|---  
|  21\. FOUR-STORY LIMIT  22\. NINE PER CENT {{movement}}  23\. PARALLEL {{pathways}}  24\. SACRED SITES  25\. ACCESS TO WATER  26\. LIFE CYCLE  27\. MEN AND WOMEN   
---|---

---|---  
|  35\. HOUSEHOLD MIX  36\. DEGREES OF PUBLICNESS  37\. {{structures}} CLUSTER  38\. ROW {{structures}}  39\. HOUSING HILL  40\. OLD {{agents}} EVERYWHERE   
---|---  
|  Between the {{structures}} clusters, around the centers, and especially in the boundaries between {{localities}}, encourage the formation of work {{localities}}:   
  
---|---  
|  41\. WORK {{localities}}  42\. INDUSTRIAL RIBBON  43\. UNIVERSITY AS A MARKETPLACE  44\. LOCAL {{settlements}} HALL  45\. NECKLACE OF {{localities}} PROJECTS  46\. MARKET OF MANY SHOPS  47\. HEALTH CENTER  48\. HOUSING IN BETWEEN   
---|---  
|  Between the {{structures}} clusters and work {{localities}}, allow the local {{pathways}} and {{pathways}} network to grow informally, piecemeal:   
  
---|---  
|  49\. LOOPED LOCAL {{pathways}}  50\. T JUNCTIONS  51\. GREEN {{pathways}}  52\. NETWORK OF {{pathways}} AND CARS  53\. MAIN GATEWAYS  54\. {{pathways}} CROSSING  55\. RAISED WALK  56\. BIKE {{pathways}} AND RACKS  57\. CHILDREN IN THE {{settlements}}   
---|---  
|  In the {{localities}} and {{localities}}, provide public open land where {{agents}} can relax, rub shoulders and renew themselves:   
  
---|---  
|  58\. CARNIVAL  59\. QUIET BACKS  60\. ACCESSIBLE GREEN  61\. SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES  62\. HIGH PLACES  63\. DANCING IN THE {{pathways}}  64\. POOLS AND STREAMS  65\. BIRTH PLACES  66\. HOLY GROUND   
---|---

---|---  
|  67\. COMMON LAND  68\. CONNECTED PLAY  69\. PUBLIC OUTDOOR {{spaces}}  70\. GRAVE SITES  71\. STILL WATER  72\. LOCAL SPORTS  73\. ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND  74\. ANIMALS   
---|---  
|  Within the framework of the common land, the clusters, and the work {{localities}} encourage transformation of the smallest independent social institutions: the families, workgroups, and gathering places. The family, in all its forms:   
  
---|---  
|  75\. THE FAMILY  76\. {{structures}} FOR A SMALL FAMILY  77\. {{structures}} FOR A COUPLE  78\. {{structures}} FOR ONE {{agents}}  79\. YOUR OWN HOME

---|---  
|  80\. SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES  81\. SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED TAPE   
---|---  
|  The first group of patterns helps to lay out the overall:   
  
---|---  
|  82\. OFFICE CONNECTIONS  83\. MASTER AND APPRENTICES  84\. TEENAGE SOCIETY  85\. SHOPFRONT SCHOOLS  86\. CHILDREN'S HOME  87\. INDIVIDUALLY OWNED SHOPS  88\. {{pathways}} CAFE  89\. CORNER GROCERY  90\. BEER HALL  91\. TRAVELER'S INN  92\. BUS STOP  93\. FOOD STANDS  94\. SLEEPING IN PUBLIC   
---|---  
{{structures}}  
---  
|  This completes the global patterns which define a {{settlements}} or a part of the {{localities}}. We now start that part of the language which gives shape to groups of {{structures}}, and individual {{structures}}, on the land, in three dimensions. These are the patterns which can be "designed" or "built"- the patterns which define the individual {{structures}} and the {{spaces}} between {{structures}}; where we are dealing for the first time with Patterns that are under the control of individuals or small groups of individuals, who are able to build the patterns all at once:   
  
---|---  
|  Arrangement of a group of {{structures}}: the height and number of these {{structures}}, the entrances to the site, main {{movement}} {{spaces}} and lines of movement through the complex:   
  
---|---  
|  95\. {{structures}} COMPLEX  96\. NUMBER OF STORIES  97\. SHIELDED {{movement}}  98\. CIRCULATION REALMS   
---|---  
|  The local shops and gathering places:   
  
---|---  
|  99\. MAIN {{structures}}  100\. PEDESTRIAN {{pathways}}  101\. {{structures}} THOROUGHFARE  102\. FAMILY OF ENTRANCES  103\. SMALL {{movement}} LOTS   
---|---  
|  Fix the position of individual {{structures}} on the site, within the complex, one by one, according to the nature of the site, the trees, the sun: this is one of the most important moments in the language:   
  
---|---  
|  104\. SITE REPAIR  105\. SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS  106\. POSITIVE OUTDOOR {{spaces}}  107\. WINGS OF LIGHT  108\. CONNECTED {{structures}}  109\. LONG THIN {{structures}}   
---|---  
|  Within the {{structures}}' wings, lay out the entrances, the gardens, courtyards, roofs, and terraces: shape both the volume of the {{structures}} and the volume of the {{spaces}} between the {{structures}} at the same time-remembering that indoor {{spaces}} and outdoor {{spaces}}, Yin and Yang, must always get their shape together:   
  
---|---  
|  110\. MAIN ENTRANCE  111\. HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN  112\. ENTRANCE TRANSITION  113\. CAR CONNECTION  114\. HIERARCHY OF OPEN {{spaces}}  115\. COURTYARDS WHICH LIVE  116\. CASCADE OF ROOFS  117\. SHELTERING ROOF  118\. ROOF GARDEN   
---|---  
|  When the major parts of {{structures}} and the outdoor {{spaces}} have been given their rough shape, it is the right time to give more detailed attention to the {{pathways}} and squares between the {{structures}}:   
  
---|---  
|  119\. ARCADES  120\. {{pathways}} AND GOALS  121\. {{pathways}} SHAPE  122\. {{structures}} FRONTS  123\. PEDESTRIAN DENSITY  124\. {{processes}} POCKETS  125\. STAIR SEATS  126\. SOMETHING ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE   
---|---  
|  Now, with the {{pathways}} fixed, we come back to the {{structures}}: within the various wings of any one {{structures}}, work out the fundamental gradients of {{spaces}}, and decide how the movement will connect the {{spaces}} in the gradients:   
  
---|---  
|  127\. INTIMACY GRADIENT  128\. INDOOR SUNLIGHT  129\. COMMON {{spaces}} AT THE HEART  130\. ENTRANCE {{spaces}}  131\. THE FLOW THROUGH {{spaces}}  132\. SHORT PASSAGES  133\. STAIRCASE AS A STAGE  134\. ZEN VIEW  135\. TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK   
---|---  
|  Within the framework of the wings and their internal gradients of {{spaces}} and movement, define the most important {{spaces}} and {{spaces}}. First, for a {{structures}}:   
  
---|---  
|  136\. COUPLE'S REALM  137\. CHILDREN'S REALM  138\. SLEEPING TO THE EAST  139\. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN   
---|---  
|  Prepare to knit the inside of the {{structures}} to the outside, by treating the edge between the two as a place in its own right, and making human details there:   
  
---|---  
|  140\. PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE {{pathways}}  141\. A {{spaces}} OF ONE'S OWN  142\. SEQUENCE OF SITTING {{spaces}}  143\. BED CLUSTER  144\. BATHING {{spaces}}  145\. BULK STORAGE   
---|---

---|---  
|  146\. FLEXIBLE OFFICE {{spaces}}  147\. COMMUNAL EATING  148\. SMALL WORK GROUPS  149\. RECEPTION WELCOMES YOU  150\. A PLACE TO WAIT   
---|---  
|  Decide on the arrangement of the gardens, and the places in the gardens:   
  
---|---  
|  151\. SMALL MEETING {{spaces}}  152\. HALF-PRIVATE OFFICE   
---|---  
|  Add those small outbuildings which must be slightly independent from the main {{structures}}, and put in the access from the upper stories to the {{pathways}} and gardens:   
  
---|---  
|  I 53. {{spaces}} TO RENT  154\. TEENAGER'S COTTAGE  155\. OLD AGE COTTAGE  156\. SETTLED WORK  157\. HOME WORKSHOP  158\. OPEN STAIRS  159\.

TRELLISED WALK  175\. GREENHOUSE  176\. GARDEN SEAT  177\. VEGETABLE GARDEN  178\. COMPOST   
---|---  
|  Go back to the inside of the {{structures}} and attach the necessary minor {{spaces}} and alcoves to complete the main {{spaces}}:   
  
---|---  
|  179\. ALCOVES  180\. WINDOW PLACE  181\. THE FIRE  182\. EATING ATMOSPHERE  183\. WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE  184\. COOKING LAYOUT  185\. SITTING CIRCLE  186\. COMMUNAL SLEEPING  187\. MARRIAGE BED  188\. BED ALCOVE  189\. DRESSING {{spaces}}   
---|---  
|  Fine tune the shape and size of {{spaces}} and alcoves to make them precise and buildable:   
  
---|---  
|  190\. CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY  191\. THE SHAPE OF INDOOR {{spaces}}  192\. WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE  193\. HALF-OPEN WALL  194\. INTERIOR WINDOWS  195\. STAIRCASE VOLUME  196\. CORNER DOORS   
---|---  
|  Give all the walls some depth, wherever there are to be alcoves, windows, shelves, closets, or seats:   
  
---|---  
|  197\. THICK WALLS  198\. CLOSETS BETWEEN {{spaces}}  199\. SUNNY COUNTER  200\. OPEN SHELVES  201\. WAIST-HIGH SHELF  202\. BUILT-IN SEATS  203\. CHILD CAVES  204\. SECRET PLACE   
---|---  
{{creation}}  
---  
|  At this stage, you have a complete design for an individual {{structures}}. If you have followed the patterns given, you have a scheme of {{spaces}}, either marked on the ground, with stakes, or on a piece of paper, accurate to the nearest foot or so. You know the height of {{spaces}}, the rough size and position of windows and doors, and you know roughly how the roofs I of the {{structures}}, and the gardens are laid out:   
  
---|---  
|  The next, and last part of the language tells how to make a buildable {{structures}} directly from this rough scheme of {{spaces}}, and tells you how to build it in detail:   
  
---|---  
|  Before you lay out structural details, establish a philosophy of {{structures}} which will let the {{structures}} grow directly from your plans and your conception of the {{structures}}:   
  
---|---  
|  205\. {{structures}} FOLLOWS SOCIAL {{spaces}}  206\. EFFICIENT {{structures}}  207\. GOOD MATERIALS  208\. GRADUAL STIFFENING   
---|---  
|  Within this philosophy of {{structures}}, on the basis of the plans which you have made, work out the complete structural layout; this is the last thing you do on paper, before you actually start to build:   
  
---|---  
|  209\. ROOF LAYOUT  210\. FLOOR AND CEILING LAYOUT  211\. THICKENING THE OUTER WALLS  212\. COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS  213\. FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION   
---|---  
|  Put stakes in the ground to mark the columns on the site, and start erecting the main frame of the {{structures}} according to the layout of these stakes:

---|---  
|  Within the main frame of the {{structures}}, fix the exact positions for openings-the doors and windows-and frame these openings:   
  
---|---  
|  221\. NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS  222\. LOW SILL  223\. DEEP REVEALS  224\. LOW DOORWAY  225\. FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES   
---|---  
|  As you build the main frame and its openings, put in the following subsidiary patterns where they are appropriate:   
  
---|---  
|  226\. COLUMN PLACE  227\. COLUMN CONNECTION  228\. STAIR.VAULT  229\. DUCT {{spaces}}-  230\. RADIANT HEAT  231\. DORMER WINDOWS  232\. ROOF CAPS

---|---  
|  249\. ORNAMENT  250\. WARM COLORS  251\. DIFFERENT CHAIRS  252\. POOLS OF LIGHT 5  253\. THINGS FROM YOUR LIFE

TOWNS  
---  
|  The language begins with patterns that define towns and communities. These patterns can never be designed or built in one fell swoop - but patient piecemeal growth, designed in such a way that every individual act is always helping to create or generate these larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the years, make a community that has these global patterns in it.

BUILDINGS  
---  
|  This completes the global patterns which define a town or a part of the community. We now start that part of the language which gives shape to groups of buildings, and individual buildings, on the land, in three dimensions. These are the patterns which can be "designed" or "built"- the patterns which define the individual buildings and the space between buildings; where we are dealing for the first time with Patterns that are under the control of individuals or small groups of individuals, who are able to build the patterns all at once:   
  
---|---  
|  Arrangement of a group of buildings: the height and number of these buildings, the entrances to the site, main parking areas and lines of movement through the complex:

|  104\. SITE REPAIR  105\. SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS  106\. POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE  107\. WINGS OF LIGHT  108\. CONNECTED BUILDINGS  109\. LONG THIN HOUSE   
---|---  
|  Within the buildings' wings, lay out the entrances, the gardens, courtyards, roofs, and terraces: shape both the volume of the buildings and the volume of the space between the buildings at the same time-remembering that indoor space and outdoor space, Yin and Yang, must always get their shape together:

|  When the major parts of buildings and the outdoor areas have been given their rough shape, it is the right time to give more detailed attention to the paths and squares between the buildings:   
  
---|---  
|  119\. ARCADES  120\. PATHS AND GOALS  121\. PATH SHAPE  122\. BUILDING FRONTS  123\. PEDESTRIAN DENSITY  124\. ACTIVITY POCKETS  125\. STAIR SEATS  126\. SOMETHING ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE   
---|---  
|  Now, with the paths fixed, we come back to the buildings: within the various wings of any one building, work out the fundamental gradients of space, and decide how the movement will connect the spaces in the gradients:   
  
---|---  
|  127\. INTIMACY GRADIENT  128\. INDOOR SUNLIGHT  129\. COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART  130\. ENTRANCE ROOM  131\. THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS  132\. SHORT PASSAGES  133\. STAIRCASE AS A STAGE  134\. ZEN VIEW  135\. TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK   
---|---  
|  Within the framework of the wings and their internal gradients of space and movement, define the most important areas and rooms. First, for a house:   
  
---|---  
|  136\. COUPLE'S REALM  137\. CHILDREN'S REALM  138\. SLEEPING TO THE EAST  139\. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN   
---|---  
|  Prepare to knit the inside of the building to the outside, by treating the edge between the two as a place in its own right, and making human details there:   
  
---|---  
|  140\. PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET  141\. A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN  142\. SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES  143\. BED CLUSTER  144\. BATHING ROOM  145\. BULK STORAGE   
---|---  
|  Then the same for offices, workshops, and public buildings:   
  
---|---  
|  146\. FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE  147\. COMMUNAL EATING  148\. SMALL WORK GROUPS  149\. RECEPTION WELCOMES YOU  150\. A PLACE TO WAIT   
---|---  
|  Decide on the arrangement of the gardens, and the places in the gardens:   
  
---|---  
|  151\. SMALL MEETING ROOMS  152\. HALF-PRIVATE OFFICE   
---|---  
|  Add those small outbuildings which must be slightly independent from the main structure, and put in the access from the upper stories to the street and gardens:   
  
---|---  
|  I 53. ROOMS TO RENT  154\. TEENAGER'S COTTAGE  155\. OLD AGE COTTAGE  156\. SETTLED WORK  157\. HOME WORKSHOP  158\. OPEN STAIRS  159\. LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM  160\. BUILDING EDGE  161\. SUNNY PLACE  162\. NORTH FACE  163\. OUTDOOR ROOM  164\. STREET WINDOWS  165\. OPENING TO THE STREET  166\. GALLERY SURROUND  167\. SIX-FOOT BALCONY  168\. CONNECTION TO THE EARTH  169\. TERRACED SLOPE  170\. FRUIT TREES  171\. TREE PLACES  172\. GARDEN GROWING WILD  173\. GARDEN WALL  174\. TRELLISED WALK  175\. GREENHOUSE  176\. GARDEN SEAT  177\. VEGETABLE GARDEN  178\. COMPOST   
---|---  
|  Go back to the inside of the building and attach the necessary minor rooms and alcoves to complete the main rooms:   
  
---|---  
|  179\. ALCOVES  180\. WINDOW PLACE  181\. THE FIRE  182\. EATING ATMOSPHERE  183\. WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE  184\. COOKING LAYOUT  185\. SITTING CIRCLE  186\. COMMUNAL SLEEPING  187\. MARRIAGE BED  188\. BED ALCOVE  189\. DRESSING ROOM   
---|---  
|  Fine tune the shape and size of rooms and alcoves to make them precise and buildable:   
  
---|---  
|  190\. CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY  191\. THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE  192\. WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE  193\. HALF-OPEN WALL  194\. INTERIOR WINDOWS  195\. STAIRCASE VOLUME  196\. CORNER DOORS   
---|---  
|  Give all the walls some depth, wherever there are to be alcoves, windows, shelves, closets, or seats:   
  
---|---  
|  197\. THICK WALLS  198\. CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS  199\. SUNNY COUNTER  200\. OPEN SHELVES  201\. WAIST-HIGH SHELF  202\. BUILT-IN SEATS  203\. CHILD CAVES  204\. SECRET PLACE   
---|---  
CONSTRUCTION  
---  
|  At this stage, you have a complete design for an individual building. If you have followed the patterns given, you have a scheme of spaces, either marked on the ground, with stakes, or on a piece of paper, accurate to the nearest foot or so. You know the height of rooms, the rough size and position of windows and doors, and you know roughly how the roofs I of the building, and the gardens are laid out:   
  
---|---  
|  The next, and last part of the language tells how to make a buildable building directly from this rough scheme of spaces, and tells you how to build it in detail:   
  
---|---  
|  Before you lay out structural details, establish a philosophy of structure which will let the structure grow directly from your plans and your conception of the buildings:   
  
---|---  
|  205\. STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES  206\. EFFICIENT STRUCTURE  207\. GOOD MATERIALS  208\. GRADUAL STIFFENING   
---|---  
|  Within this philosophy of structure, on the basis of the plans which you have made, work out the complete structural layout; this is the last thing you do on paper, before you actually start to build:   
  
---|---  
|  209\. ROOF LAYOUT  210\. FLOOR AND CEILING LAYOUT  211\. THICKENING THE OUTER WALLS  212\. COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS  213\. FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION   
---|---  
|  Put stakes in the ground to mark the columns on the site, and start erecting the main frame of the building according to the layout of these stakes:   
  
---|---  
|  214\. ROOT FOUNDATIONS  215\. GROUND FLOOR SLAB  216\. BOX COLUMNS  217\. PERIMETER BEAMS  218\. WALL MEMBRANES  219\. FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS  220\. ROOF VAULTS   
---|---  
|  Within the main frame of the building, fix the exact positions for openings-the doors and windows-and frame these openings:   
  
---|---  
|  221\. NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS  222\. LOW SILL  223\. DEEP REVEALS  224\. LOW DOORWAY  225\. FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES   
---|---  
|  As you build the main frame and its openings, put in the following subsidiary patterns where they are appropriate:   
  
---|---  
|  226\. COLUMN PLACE  227\. COLUMN CONNECTION  228\. STAIR.VAULT  229\. DUCT SPACE-  230\. RADIANT HEAT  231\. DORMER WINDOWS  232\. ROOF CAPS   
---|---  
|  Put in the surfaces and indoor details:   
  
---|---  
|  233\. FLOOR SURFACE  234\. LAPPED OUTSIDE WALLS  235\. SOFT INSIDE WALLS  236\. WINDOWS WHICH OPEN WIDE  237\. SOLID DOORS WITH GLASS  238\. FILTERED LIGHT  239\. SMALL PANES  240\. HALF-INCH TRIM   
---|---  
|  Build outdoor details to finish the outdoors as fully as the indoor spaces:   
  
---|---  
|  241\. SEAT SPOTS  242\. FRONT DOOR BENCH  243\. SITTING WALL  244\. CANVAS ROOFS  245\. RAISED FLOWERS  246\. CLIMBING PLANTS  247\. PAVING WITH CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES  248\. SOFT TILE AND BRICK   
---|---  
|  Complete the building with ornament and light and color and your own things:   
  
---|---  
|  249\. ORNAMENT  250\. WARM COLORS  251\. DIFFERENT CHAIRS  252\. POOLS OF LIGHT 5  253\. THINGS FROM YOUR LIFE
